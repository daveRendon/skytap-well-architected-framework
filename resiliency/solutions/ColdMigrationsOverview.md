**MIGRATE “AS IS”**

<li>Backup and Move AIX and IBM I / AS400 Workloads unchanged

<li>Like for like architecture ensures applications run in Azure without changes

<li>Quickly exit the datacenter

<li>Eliminate dependencies on hardware contracts and support costs  

**Protect**
<li>Offer heterogeneous protection for any workload, now running on Azure
<li>Protect at every phase: On-Prem, Hybrid, Pure Azure and Cross Cloud
<li>Backup to object storage, save costs with consumption based spend
 <li>Disaster Recovery for AIX / IBM I in Azure

**Innovate and Scale**
<li>Leverage Azure native services in region (Data Lake, AKS, Global Reach, etc…)
<li>Modernize the POWER workloads over time based on initial migration and protection footprint
<li>Optimize file system, shorten recovery time, utilize cost effective storage solutions in Azure

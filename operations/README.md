# Overview of the operational excellence pillar

**Operational Excellence**

This pillar covers the operational best practices and processes that keep workloads running in production. 

Deployments and maintenance must be reliable and predictable. They should be automated to reduce the chance of human error. They should be a fast and routine process, so they don't slow down the release of new features or bug fixes. Equally important, you must be able to quickly roll back or roll forward if an update has problems.

The steps in this guide can help the strategy team lead the organizational change management required to consistently ensure operational excellence.

These are the disciplines we group in the operational excellence pillar:

| [Phase 01C - Sizing and Design](./Sizing_Design/README.md) | The monitoring and management of performance and availability of software applications through DevOps |
| [Phase 01D - EcoSystem](./Ecosystems/README.md) | How you deploy your application code is going to be one of the key factors that will determine your application stability  |
| [Phase 01E - Testing](./Testing/README.md) | Testing is fundamental to be prepared for the unexpected and to catch mistakes before they impact users |

## **Connectivity**

**Summary**

Building a reliable network in the cloud is different from
traditional on-premise environments. While historically you may have
purchased levels of redundant higher-end hardware to minimize the chance
of an entire network stack failing, in the cloud, we acknowledge
up front that failures will happen. Instead of trying to prevent
failures altogether, the goal is to minimize the effects of a single
failing component. .

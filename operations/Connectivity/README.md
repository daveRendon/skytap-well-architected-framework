## **Task: Connectivity**

**Summary**

Building a reliable application in the cloud is different from
traditional application development. While historically you may have
purchased levels of redundant higher-end hardware to minimize the chance
of an entire application platform failing, in the cloud, we acknowledge
up front that failures will happen. Instead of trying to prevent
failures altogether, the goal is to minimize the effects of a single
failing component. Failures you can expect here are inherent to highly
distributed systems, not a feature of Azure.


## **Key Points**

-   Use Availability Zones where applicable to improve reliability and
    optimize costs.

-   Design applications to operate when impacted by failures.

-   Use the native resiliency capabilities of PaaS to support overall
    application reliability.

-   Design to scale out.

-   Validate that required capacity is within Azure service scale limits
    and quotas.

# Overview of the operational excellence pillar

**Operational Excellence**

This pillar covers the operational best practices and processes that keep workloads running in production. 

Deployments and maintenance must be reliable and predictable. They should be automated to reduce the chance of human error. They should be a fast and routine process, so they don't slow down the release of new features or bug fixes. Equally important, you must be able to quickly roll back or roll forward if an update has problems.

The steps in this guide can help the strategy team lead the organizational change management required to consistently ensure operational excellence.

These are the disciplines we group in the operational excellence pillar:

| Operational excellence disciplines | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| [Phase 01 - Discovery](./discovery.md) | Provides guidance on how to design, build, and orchestrate workloads with DevOps principles in mind  |
| [Phase 02 - Connectivity](./connectivity.md) | Something that enterprises have been doing for years, enriched with some specifics for applications running in the cloud |
| [Phase 03 - Sizing and Design](./sizing_design.md) | The monitoring and management of performance and availability of software applications through DevOps |
| [Phase 04 - EcoSystem](./ecosystem.md) | How you deploy your application code is going to be one of the key factors that will determine your application stability  |
| [Phase 05 - Migration](./migration.md) | Frequently known as "Automation" or "Infrastructure as code", this discipline refers to best practices for deploying the platform where your application will run on |
| [Phase 06 - Testing](./testing.md) | Testing is fundamental to be prepared for the unexpected and to catch mistakes before they impact users |

## Business Drivers - the case for change
**SAP NetWeaver based workloads on IBM Power on Skytap on Azure**

1.  Business Continuity: NetWeaver workloads requiring Cloud Backup/DR
2.  Regulation and Compliance: NetWeaver workloads in read-only state in Azure
3.  IBM Power Data Center exit : NetWeaver workloads to Azure
4.  Modernization of Business Processes:

    a.  Move NetWeaver workloads to Skytap on Azure to enable them to inter-operate
 with SAP HANA based workloads or other Business Applications running on Azure
    b.  Move NetWeaver workloads to Skytap on Azure to enable them to be more easily transition to SAP HANA

***Drivers and Requirements:***

-   *Data Center Exit*

-   *Maintain Self-Service Control over ALL infrastructure*

-   *Ability to Upgrade and Test in Azure*

-   *Seamless Hybrid Connectivity between On-Premises and Azure*

-   *Seamless Hybrid Connectivity between x86 and AIX workloads in Azure (SAP and non-SAP interconnectivity)*

-   *Archive and Restore Capability for Compliance*
